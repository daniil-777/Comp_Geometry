# Assignment 3

Edit this 'README.md' file to report all your results. There is no need to write lengthy reports, just show the requested outputs and screenshots and quickly summarize your observations. Please add your additional files or notes in the folder 'assignment3 /results' and refer to or directly show them in this page.

## Required results

### Mandatory Tasks
1) Show the screenshots of 2 (non-noisy) meshes of your choice from the data folder shaded with the 5 different normals. For the PCA normals show them with k=3 and k=6, for the quadratic fitted normals show them each with two different values for k (make sure you have at least 5 points when fitting the quadratic bivariate polynomial).

2) Report your matching between curvature expressions and the figures. Provide a short motivation for your matchings.

3) Show screenshots of 1 (non-noisy) mesh of your choice from the data folder coloured according to the 4 discrete curvature measures.

4) Report your findings on the differences between implicit and explicit Laplacian smoothing, the differences between uniform vs cotangent weights and report the parameters you used and how changing them affects the result. Also show screenshots of both the implicit and explicit Laplacian smoothing results for 1 mesh from the data folder.

5) Report your findings on the comparison with results you obtained with the Laplacian smoothing vs with bilateral smoothing. Show screenshots of bilateral smoothing applied to 1 **noisy** mesh from the data folder.
